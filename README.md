# Copra c++11

This is a fork of the Copra library by Dr. Vincent SAMY with c++ 11 compatability, and do remember to turn `DISABLE_TESTS` option ON with `ccmake .` during building.
Please refer to the original [repo](https://github.com/vsamy/copra) for more information and also you can find a example [here](https://vsamy.github.io/en/blog/copra-example-cpp).
